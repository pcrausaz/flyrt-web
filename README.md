In a world where travelers spend hours waiting between flights or trains, Flyrt makes these moments more enjoyable by connecting people in the same transit locations.
Imagine matching with someone in the same airport as you, sharing a coffee while waiting or even discovering a new travel companion for a future destination.

Flyrt sets itself apart from other apps by its unique approach: on the one hand, time is limited which boosts the sharing experience and on the other hand, it targets travel moments, facilitating instant connections in specific locations. If you are going to the same destination, you can extend the experience; otherwise, you will have spent a pleasant time together and perhaps planned a future trip. Make new friends, message with the friends you want and use our tracker to find the friends near you.

Using Flyrt you can message and locate friends as long as you mutually agree to it.
 
Whether you are traveling for business or pleasure, Flyrt makes every stopover an adventure.
